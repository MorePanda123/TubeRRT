Tube-RRT*: Efficient Homotopic Path Planning for Swarm Robotics Passing-Through Large-Scale Obstacle Environments

**Tube-RRT*** is an efficient homotopic pah planning algorithm that builds upon and improves the Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm. Tube-RRT* is specifically designed to generate homotopic paths for the trajectories in the virtual tube, strategically considering opening volume and tube length to mitigate swarm congestion and ensure agile navigation.
